## Training a CNN model on CIFAR10 dataset

[Detailed Blog](https://akshaysin.github.io/cifar_cnn.html#.W2qrGShKhPY)

**Pre requisites**

* [CIFAR10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz)
* [Keras](https://blog.keras.io/introducing-keras-2.html)
* Python 3.6

Make sure to first of all download the cifar-10 data first from the link given above and unzip it along side the script.

I have added the comments through out the script to guide the user through each step. First part of the script deals with pre processing of the data and secornd part is the keras model it self. Detailed intructions can also be found in this [Blog Post](https://akshaysin.github.io/cifar_cnn.html#.W2qrGShKhPY)

Please note that accuracy of this model is only around ~ 62% as I only ran it for demonstration purposes.
